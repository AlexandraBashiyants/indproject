The end of the school year is approaching and this is my last news post. All the time we are either writing tests and tests, or preparing for them.The hardest thing is to sit and wait for the results. But I hope that there will be A's in non-core subjects, of the stories only in the basic History of Russia, I have exactly 5, the rest is unclear...

The session is close and I hope that I will close everything well)
