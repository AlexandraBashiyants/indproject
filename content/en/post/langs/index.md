## Introduction

In this article, we will talk about scientific programming and which languages are best used for working in science.

## What is scientific programming?

Scientific programming is a highly oriented programming style for scientific calculations. It is distinguished from other types of programming by the extreme correctness and stability of the final product, the strict separation of scientific and interface parts, the individuality of algorithms, and the predominance of efficiency over versatility.

Where is scientific programming applied?   Scientific programming is at the core of any modern global research. All advanced technologies, from quantum computers to space programs, would not be possible without scientific programming specialists who can provide scientists with a reliable and accurate tool for making discoveries.

A number of branches of science directly depend on the level of development of scientific programming. So, unmanned vehicles, "smart" management systems for urban and agricultural enterprises, stock exchanges, robotics, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence that surpasses human capabilities are waiting for their fulfillment.

Scientific programming languages

Different existing programming languages can be used in different fields, but in this article I want to talk about three.

## 1. R

R, which is a direct descendant of the older programming language S, was released back in 1995 and has been improving ever since. Written in languages such as C and Fortran, this project is currently supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. An excellent set of high-quality, open-source domain-specific packages. R has packages at its disposal for almost any quantitative and statistical application imaginable. This includes neural networks, nonlinear regression, phylogenetics, building complex diagrams, graphs, and much, much more. Along with the basic installation, we also have the option to install extensive built-in functions and methods. In addition, R handles matrix algebra data perfectly.R is a powerful language that has a huge selection of applications for statistical data collection and data visualization, and the fact that it is an open source software allows it to gather a large number of fans among developers. It is due to its effectiveness for the initial purposes that this programming language has managed to achieve wide popularity.

## 2. Python

Python is one of the most popular programming languages at the moment. It has a simple syntax and a wide variety of libraries and frameworks that will help you achieve the desired task.

Python is a good option for data science purposes, and this statement is true for both beginner and advanced levels of work in this field. Much of data science is centered around the ETL (extract-transform-load) process. This feature makes Python an ideal programming language for such purposes.

## 3. Julia

Released just over 5 years ago, Julia has made an impression on the world of computational methods. The language has achieved such popularity due to the fact that several large organizations, including some in the financial industry, almost immediately began using it for their own purposes. Julia is a compiled JIT (just–in-time) language that allows you to achieve good performance. This language is quite simple, it provides the possibilities of dynamic typing and scripting of an interpreted language such as Python. Julia was designed for numerical analysis, and it can also be considered a general-purpose programming language. Of course, this language has its drawbacks, the main one being its youth. This language does not have enough software packages yet, but in a few years it will be able to compete with its main competitors.

## Conclusion

Scientific programming and the languages in which it can be used are gaining unprecedented popularity due to the progress that is taking place in our society. It allows scientists to develop technologies and transform our world into the “world of the future.”
