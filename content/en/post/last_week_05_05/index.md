The week of June 05-11 passed quite calmly. There were few classes (as well as people in them). I worked on the weekend, and on the 9th we watched the parade in the morning, and in the evening we tried to go and watch the fireworks, but it turned out that he wasn't with us, but we watched it anyway.

And on Sunday, 11.05, my best friend's birthday was, we went to play on D&D, and I was the only one who died there(. The photo shows my character, a Black Lady. We had a good time.
