My week went well, except that I got sick. We have covered many interesting topics in Linear Algebra and Mathematical Analysis. They also spoke on humanitarian subjects. But the most interesting part was on Monday and Wednesday.
On Monday, the groups of the Translator Module performed songs and productions. The guys are great, even though I didn't participate, I supported everyone.
And on Wednesday we had a couple on the Basics of military training. I picked up a gas mask for the first time and passed the standard on the first attempt: closing my eyes and holding my breath, I need to get the gas mask out of my bag and put it on in 7 seconds. I did it in 5.57.
