The beginning of this week was quiet. Studies, work, friends, rumors, gossip, investigations. But there was a little trip at the end. We applied for a visa and went to another city to be interviewed. All Thursday at the airport... On Friday, we went to the consulate and sat there for several hours, but everything seemed to go well, we already had a plane home in the afternoon. And on the weekend, I have scotch and boxes waiting for me. I'll be helping my friend with the move.
