Last weekend we celebrated Mom's birthday. We went to the countryside, and in the evening I gave her a huge delicious cake.

We also wrote a Linear Algebra test. It's a nightmare and a horror, but I hope everything will be okay.

On Tuesday, I went to my friend's house to sort things out, as she had moved out.

At the IAB, we dressed up in a uniform with an armored vest. It was fun because it was heavy, and the teacher was showing me what to do.
