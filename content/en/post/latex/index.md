## Markup languages. LaTeX.

▌Introduction

In today's world, where information is everywhere, not only its essence is important, but also how it is presented. This is where markup languages come to the rescue. They allow you to give the text structure, format it for easy perception and make it compatible with various platforms. In this report, we will look at the concept of markup languages in general and delve into the study of one of the most powerful and respected representatives of this class – LaTeX.

,What is a markup language?

A markup language is a notation system used to add additional information to a text about its structure, formatting, and semantics. Unlike visual editors like WYSIWYG ("What You See Is What You Get"), markup languages use text commands (tags or special characters) to specify the desired appearance of the document. Subsequently, a special program (compiler or interpreter) processes this marked-up text and converts it into a final format, for example, HTML, PDF or DOCX.

Key features of markup languages:

• Text format: Easy to read and edit with a regular text editor.
• Platform independence: Can be processed on different operating systems.
• Clear separation of content and presentation: The content remains clean and easily modifiable, while the markup defines its appearance.
• Automation capability: Allows you to automate the process of formatting and generating documents.

Examples of markup languages:

• HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The main language for creating web pages.
• XML (Extensible Markup Language): A universal language for representing data.
 Markdown: A lightweight and simple markup language for writing text documents, often used for documentation, README files, and online articles.
 LaTeX: A markup language especially popular in scientific circles for creating complex documents with formulas, graphs, and bibliographies.

LaTeX: The magic of precise typography

LaTeX (pronounced "Latech" or "Latex") is a markup language based on TeX, developed by Leslie Lamport in the 1980s. It is designed to create professional-quality documents, especially in scientific and technical fields. LaTeX has exceptional capabilities for formatting mathematical formulas, managing bibliographies, creating complex tables and graphs, and structuring large documents such as books and dissertations.

Advantages of LaTeX:

• High-quality typography: LaTeX provides exceptional text and formula display quality, making documents pleasant to read and professional-looking.
• Automated formatting: LaTeX takes over most of the routine formatting work, such as section numbering, creating a table of contents and bibliography.
• Exceptional math capabilities: LaTeX has a powerful command set for complex mathematical formulas, equations, and symbols.
• Bibliography Management: LaTeX makes it easy to manage bibliographic data using files.bib and automatically generate literature lists in various styles.
• Support for extensions (packages): The large number of available packages allows you to extend the functionality of LaTeX and adapt it to specific needs.
• Stability and reliability: LaTeX is a mature and well–tested markup language used worldwide.

Disadvantages of LaTeX:

• Steeper learning curve: Compared to WYSIWYG editors, LaTeX requires some time to learn syntax and commands.
• Not WYSIWYG: You don't see the formatting result during the writing process. It is necessary to compile the document to view the changes.
• More difficult debugging: Syntax errors can be difficult to debug, especially for beginners.

LaTeX code example:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\title{The Pythagorean Theorem}
\author{Your Name}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
In geometry, the Pythagorean theorem establishes the relationship between the sides of a right triangle.

\section{Statement of the theorem}
In a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs.  Mathematically, this can be written as:

\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}

where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the legs, and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse.

\end{document}

In this example:

• defines the type of document (article).
• downloads a package for working with mathematical formulas.
• , , set the title, author, and date.
• \begin(document) and \end(document) restrict the beginning and end of the document.
•  

§ (...)
defines the section headings.
• \begin(equation) and \end(equation) are used to display the mathematical formula in a separate line.
• It is used to display mathematical symbols inside the text.

Tools for working with LaTeX:

• Text editors: VS Code (with extensions), TeXstudio, Sublime Text (with extensions), Atom (with extensions).
• LaTeX distributions: MiKTeX (Windows), TeX Live (Linux, macOS), MacTeX (macOS).
• LaTeX online editors: Overleaf, ShareLaTeX (now part of Overleaf), Papeeria.

,LaTeX application areas

LaTeX is widely used in the following areas:

• Scientific publications: Articles, books, dissertations, reports.
• Technical documentation: User manuals, specifications, instructions.
• Mathematical and engineering documents: Textbooks, laboratory work, reports.
• Slide creation: Using the Beamer package, you can create professional-looking presentations.
• Typography: LaTeX is used to create books, magazines and other printed products.

▌Conclusion

Markup languages play an important role in creating structured and well-formatted documents. LaTeX, as one of the most powerful and flexible markup languages, provides tools for creating professional-quality documents, especially in areas where precise typography and complex mathematical formulas are required. Despite some difficulty in mastering, LaTeX pays off the effort due to the high quality and capabilities it provides. For those who work with science, technology, or just appreciate the impeccable appearance of documents, LaTeX will become an indispensable tool.
