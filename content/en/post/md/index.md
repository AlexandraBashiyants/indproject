## Lightweight markup languages


By learning Markdown, this simple and intuitive format, you can easily create attractive results. From PDF to web pages, your simple text file becomes a complex document. But Markdown isn't the only game in town. There are a number of other so-called lightweight markup languages similar to Markdown, but with different feature sets. One of them is Asciidoc. If you like Markdown, but you're looking for a bit more under the hood, it's worth considering. Here are a few reasons why.

### What is a "markup language"?

A markup language is a set of codes that, when applied to plain text, allows you to add one or more of the following properties (among others):

- Define the text
- Structure the text
- Describe the layout of the text
- Decorate the text

One markup language that you encounter every day (unless you're a hermit) is hypertext markup language, or HTML. Websites and applications that bring you news and show you your email are built, at least in part, with HTML markup that uses tags as a mechanism for marking up raw text content. For example, consider the following HTML snippet:

<body> <h1>Introducing HTML</h1> <p>Here is a paragraph in HTML... we know it's a <strong>paragraph</strong> because the surrounding \<p\> tags define it as one.</p> </body>


Here, the < p> tag indicates that all subsequent text, up to the closing tag </p>, is a paragraph. In this sense, he defines the text as a paragraph. But also pay attention to the tags... they often serve to determine the layout of a web page, for example, how many fields are on the side of the screen.

And the <strong> tags will decorate the word "paragraph" in bold, and the <h1> tags can both mark the title (separate it from the surrounding text) and define a larger font.

The problem with some markup languages (HTML among them) is that entering these tags manually is a very tedious task. And with other languages like XML, tags and their attributes make up a larger part of the overall content than the text itself!

### Enter a lightweight markup language
If you wanted to take advantage of markup languages, for example by publishing an HTML page on the internet or converting a DocBook file to PDF so that it could be printed, you had to do one of two things. On the one hand, you can spend time learning these languages inside and out, writing them down manually, and then checking your work three times. Or you could invest the money in a tool that manages the complexity of it for you.

Fortunately, some enterprising developers have come up with a third option. They created new markup languages that contained many (in some cases, most or all) of the features of their heavier counterparts, but significantly simplified the syntax. These "lightweight" languages include the familiar Markdown as well as Asciidoc, the Egc format in Org mode, and the Mediawiki syntax.

### Lightweight markup languages have a simple syntax
One of the distinguishing features of these languages is that their "tags" (such as these) must be intuitive. Let's look at the previous fragment, this time written in Asciidoc.:

 Introducing Asciidoc -------------------- Where are the *paragraph* tags? We dont need them... Asciidoc is smart enough to realize this is a paragraph! 
 
Much more readable, no? Starting from the top, we can identify the title, as it is "underlined" with strokes. You could do this if you were writing by hand, just draw an underscore under the page heading in your notebook. There are also no paragraph tags â€” Asciidoc treats anything between two empty lines that don't have any other markup on them as the "plain" text of the paragraph. Finally, the asterisks around the word "paragraph" are indicated in bold. Raise your hand if you did it in a text message to mean the same thing.

### Each has one or more corresponding processors
Heavy-weight markup languages usually have a special application for interpreting them. On the Internet, your browser and, possibly, a web server will turn the code into vivid web pages. For documents in XML format, it can be something like Microsoft Word, which reads and writes in DOCX format. (this is another dialect of XML). This way, you will never have to interact directly with the source of these documents, just the pretty facades that your applications show.

Meanwhile, documents written in light languages can be read by a person in their original form (another tenant), but only true nerds can consider them beautiful. To get a good result, you need to use a processor. These are applications that will consistently go through your markup and transform it into something else that looks good. The same projects that develop the language itself usually create a utility to use it. The Markdown project offers a Perl script with the same name, and the accompanying Asciidoc program is written in Python. In addition, other conversion utilities will include support for some of these languages. One such example is the excellent Pandoc, which will use Markdown, as well as lightweight tagging, restructured text, Mediawiki, and Org-Mode and convert them to PDF, DOCX, ODT, and others.

As a result, lightweight markup languages allow you to work with plain text, the most portable data format on the planet, but in the end they still produce beautiful results. Now that you are convinced of its advantages, which language should you choose? Markdown is undoubtedly the most popular and has its advantages (more on this later). But Asciidoc, in particular, is a worthy alternative. In the next section, we'll look at a few reasons why.

### Comparison of markdown and Asciidoc

The Asciidoc format was created to simplify DocBook, one of the most common formats when writing long (especially technical) texts. One of the requirements for fame is that it is a one-to-one translation, meaning there is a corresponding Asciidoc representation for each element in the DocBook. Below, we'll look at some of the pros and cons of Asciidoc compared to Markdown.

###Asciidoc covers a superset of written elements
Markdown's goal from the very beginning was to create a simple format for web writers. Thus, the writing elements it supports are aimed at automating the more time-consuming aspects of writing HTML (lists, for example, which require tags).

or
in addition to <li tags> for each element).
Asciidoc also contains them, but it also offers more advanced DocBook elements such as warnings (such as "Note:" or "Info:" callout blocks) and complex table layouts. That doesn't mean you have to use them all the time, but they will be there and available if you ever need them.

###Asciidoc is a single format
As Markdown's popularity began to decline, some of its users began to experience some of the disadvantages described above. So these users started developing their own extensions to address these issues, such as the ability to add tables or footnotes/notes. Soon, many "flavors" of Markdown appeared, including (among others):

The flavor used by Github for the "Readme" files of the projects it hosted.
An "extended" version based on the PHP port of the original Markdown, with additional HTML-related features.
A flavor called "MultiMarkdown" that implements many of the features of writing longer forms, including citations, definitions, and cross-references.
As a result, your document may require elements that are not all covered by the same flavor. In contrast, Asciidoc does not suffer from the same fragmentation as Markdown currently does.

###Asciidoc is aimed at a variety of publishing styles
Markdown is great for getting a blog post out of your head and onto the page quickly. But out of the box, it is not designed to structure longer works like a book. Asciidoc is designed for this, and one example is its "enable" functions. These operators allow you to include the entire contents of one file in another:

 include::somefile.adoc 
This is not much different from how basic documents work in text editors. This allows, for example, to compose each chapter as a separate file, and then "include" them all in one file representing the book. When you process this "book file", the result will be as if all the chapters were written directly into this document.

###Markdown is enough for most users
Markdown covers all the basics for most users. For those who are just looking for a blog or typing some notes in text format, Markdown supports all the elements they will need. Cross-references don't mean much to a user who just wants to create a simple note or web page. You could even use Markdown for longer work with simple layouts like roman" and combine them yourself at the end.

### Markdown is better supported
Because Markdown meets the needs of a broader segment of users, it is ultimately better supported in terms of the following:

WYSIWYG editors (as defined by those that at least provide a live preview) are more likely to support Markdown.
Online services such as the aforementioned Github are more likely to accept Markdown directly or through add-ons.

Although publishing systems such as static site generators are more likely to support Asciidoc with plugins, the fact that they support Markdown out of the box is almost self-evident.
Are you ready to try Asciidoc?

Although Markdown is something of a de facto choice among lightweight markup languages, Asciidoc contains all the same elements, and then some. Additional information about Asciidoc takes some time to learn, as it can better prepare you for larger and more complex writing projects.
